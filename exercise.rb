#Exercise 2: Write a function to print when each person died in a sentence.

dickens = ["Charles Dickens", 1870]
thackeray = ["William Thackeray", 1863]
trollope = ["Anthony Trollope", 1882]
hopkins = ["Gerard Manley Hopkins", 1889]

#Exercise 3: Print a message to a time traveler.

puts "Greetings! What is your year of origin?"

if origin < 1900
  puts "That's the past!"

#Exercise 4: Make a class to store and display a person’s info.

class Person

  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name

end

person1 = Person.new("Thomas", "Jefferson")
p person1.first_name

#Exercise 5: Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades, return an average test score, 
#a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

puts "Input exam grade one:"

puts 'Input exam grade two:'
